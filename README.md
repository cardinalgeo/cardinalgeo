### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Robert Collar, and I'm a geoscientist interested in the intersection of geochemistry and data science, especially as applied to ore deposits exploration.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the geochemistry of sediment-hosted Cu-Co deposits in the Central African Copperbelt.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [`DrillDown`](https://github.com/cardinalgeo/drilldown), a **Python visualization and analysis toolkit for "drilling down" into ore deposits datasets**.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: robert.collar@mail.mcgill.ca

- âš¡ Fun fact: From my time in California and QuÃ©bec, I've decided that winters should either be very warm or very cold...drop a line with your favorite winter activity!
